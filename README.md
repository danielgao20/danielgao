# Personal Portfolio Website

This project is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, experience, and skills in web development.

## Acknowledgments

This website is based on a template by [Ade-mir](https://github.com/Ade-mir) from the repository [html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2](https://github.com/Ade-mir/html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2). The original template, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served as a foundation for this project.

## Conversion to React

I have converted the original template from a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project to a dynamic React application. This involved breaking down the website's layout into React components, managing state where necessary, and utilizing React's ecosystem to enhance the site's interactivity and modularity.
